## Things SDK

The _Things SDK_ enables a _thing_, which can be either a physical _device_ or a software _service_, to register and
authenticate without human interaction. Once registered, the _thing_ will be represented by a digital identity in the
ForgeRock Identity Platform and can authenticate itself in order to interact with the platform tier.

See the [SDK examples](docs/run-examples.md) for information about how to use the SDK.
